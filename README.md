# US State Game
This Python project is a game that helps you learn the names of the 50 US states using the Pandas library, Turtle graphics library and a dataset containing state names & coordinates.

## Description
The game displays a blank map of the United States, and prompts the user to guess the names of the states one by one. When a correct guess is made, the state name is displayed on the map. The game continues until all 50 states are guessed or the user decides to exit. </br>
After exiting the game, a new CSV file (States_to_learn.csv) is generated containing the names of the states that were not guessed correctly.

## Installation
To run this project, you need Python installed on your system. You'll also need to install the turtle and pandas libraries. You can install them using pip: </br></br> pip install turtle pandas
